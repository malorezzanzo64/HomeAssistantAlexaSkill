# Home Assistant - Alexa Skill
Thi skill merges the functionality of [Alexa Actions](https://github.com/keatontaylor/alexa-actions) and [Home Assistant intents](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/alexa.intent/#support-for-launch-requests).

On top of that, it adds the option to customize the alexa event name and it adds the alexa slots value to the event data.

Like Alexa Actions, it needs [Alexa Media Player](https://github.com/custom-components/alexa_media_player/).
